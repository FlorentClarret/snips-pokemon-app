# The Snips Pokemon Application

## Purpose

This application is a [Snips](https://snips.ai/ "Snips's Homepage") assistant made to interact with the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ "PokeApi's Homepage").

This is my very first Snips application AND python project. I'm using it to learn both so do not expect this project to be perfect. I'm trying to not use any already existing wrapper for this API.

By default, this application hits the online PokeApi services. You can self-host it if you wish and want to be completely offline (Snips is working offline, so the raspberry does not need to be connected to the Internet).

## Hardware

I'm testing this application on a Raspberry 3B+ with a ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array.
